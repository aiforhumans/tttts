Update Summary for app.py:

- Fixed model path for VCTK from "tts_models/en/vctk/tacotron2-DDC" to "tts_models/en/vctk/vits" based on available models.
- Added support for multi-speaker models by:
  - Detecting if the loaded model has multiple speakers.
  - Adding a speaker selection dropdown in the Gradio UI that updates dynamically when the model changes.
  - Passing the selected speaker parameter to the TTS synthesis function.
- Modified the synthesize_speech function to accept a speaker argument and use it when synthesizing speech.
- Added logic to update the speaker dropdown choices when the user selects a different voice model.
- Ensured backward compatibility for single-speaker models by conditionally including the speaker parameter.
- Created an output folder "output" if it does not exist to save generated audio files.
- The UI now includes inputs for text, voice model, speech speed, and speaker selection (if applicable).
- The app runs on a local URL and supports GPU acceleration if available.

Please test the following:
- UI loads and all controls are functional.
- Selecting different voice models updates the speaker list correctly.
- Speech synthesis works for both single-speaker and multi-speaker models.
- Generated audio files are saved in the output folder.
- Audio playback works as expected.

This update addresses the previous errors related to missing speaker parameters for multi-speaker models.
