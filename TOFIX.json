  "summary": "Current issues and troubleshooting steps for TTS model loading error",
  "tried": [
    "Replaced invalid model 'tts_models/en/ljspeech/fastspeech2' with valid 'tts_models/en/ljspeech/fast_pitch' in app.py",
    "Verified available models using list_models.py and confirmed 'fast_pitch' is a valid model",
    "Attempted to download 'fast_pitch' model explicitly using a custom script",
    "Checked TTS model cache directory; found empty indicating no cached models",
    "Added error logging to JSON file in app.py to capture errors during model loading and synthesis",
    "Performed critical-path testing by launching the app and verifying basic functionality",
    "Observed repeated 'Model file not found in the output path' errors in logs and terminal",
    "Confirmed TTS package version is 0.22.0 as per requirements.txt"
  ],
  "to_resolve": [
    "Investigate why the 'fast_pitch' model files are not being downloaded or found by the TTS package",
    "Check for possible issues with TTS package version compatibility or bugs in model download manager",
    "Consider clearing any hidden or alternate cache directories used by TTS package",
    "Possibly reinstall or upgrade TTS package to latest version to fix model download issues",
    "Verify network or permission issues that might block model downloads",
    "Improve error handling and user feedback in the app for model loading failures",
    "Test with alternative valid models to isolate if issue is specific to 'fast_pitch' model"
